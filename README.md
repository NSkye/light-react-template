# Light React Template
Presetup for simple react projects, created mainly for personal use.

This presetup is based on the following stack:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)  
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

I tried to keep Webpack configuration file as minimal as possible to avoid any unnecessary complexity.
